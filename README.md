    SECRET_KEY = 'MY_PRECIOUS_SECRET_KEY'
    SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT = 'MY_TABLE_SALT'
    API_VERSION = "v0.1"
    SQL_ADMINS_URI = "sqlite:///database/admins.db"
    SQL_DEVICES_URI = "sqlite:///database/devices.db"
    DEBUG = True
    SSL = False
    SSL_CERT = ""
    SSL_KEY = ""
    BACKEND_PORT = 6712
    WEBSITE_PORT = 5000
    MAIL_SERVER = 'smtp.googlemail.com'
    MAIL_PORT = 465

    MAIL_USERNAME = "will.send.from.here@gmail.com"
    MAIL_PASSWORD = "not a passwd"

      "server": {
        "url": "https://127.0.0.1:6712",
        "version": "v0.1",
        "update": true,
